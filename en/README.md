# Effective Go

Go is a new language. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs different in character from programs written in its relatives.

This document gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code. It augments the [language specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec), [the Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/), and [How to Write Go Code](https://go.dev/doc/code.html), all of which you should read first.
